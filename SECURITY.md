## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it privately by:

1. Opening a security advisory on GitHub: https://github.com/tahsinmert/markdown-pdf-converter/security/advisories/new
2. Or emailing the maintainer directly

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond to security reports as quickly as possible and work with you to address the issue before making it public.
